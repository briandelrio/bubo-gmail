# Bubo Gmail Extension Implementation Notes

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to implement the missing modules in the Bubo Gmail extension.

## Problem
The original implementation was attempting to use dynamic imports for loading component JavaScript files, which didn't work due to Chrome extension's Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. Extensions require all resources to be listed in the manifest's `web_accessible_resources` section.

## Solution
Instead of trying to dynamically import component files, we've implemented the missing modules directly in the `content/index.js` file as inline renderer functions:

1. `renderEmailEditor()` - For editing email content with a rich text editor
2. `renderFollowupEditor()` - For editing follow-up email settings and content
3. `renderCampaignDetail()` - For viewing campaign details and metrics

Each renderer function comes with its corresponding behavior attachment function, similar to the pattern used in other components.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Email Editor
- Created an inline renderer function `renderEmailEditor()` that generates a rich text editor component
- Implemented text formatting toolbar (bold, italic, underline, lists, links)
- Added personalization token insertion dropdown
- Added template loading and saving functionality
- Implemented behaviors for saving/canceling edits

### 2. Followup Editor
- Created an inline renderer function `renderFollowupEditor()` that generates a follow-up email editor
- Added timing settings (days after previous email, time of day)
- Implemented condition settings (stop if replied, stop if opened)
- Added email subject and content editor with formatting
- Implemented behaviors for saving/canceling edits

### 3. Campaign Detail View
- Created an inline renderer function `renderCampaignDetail()` that shows campaign metrics and controls
- Displays campaign status, delivery metrics, open rates, and reply rates
- Implemented campaign control actions (pause/resume)
- Added navigation back to dashboard

### State Management
- Updated the main `state.js` to include new state properties for tracking:
  - `previousScreen` - To enable back navigation
  - `currentEmail` - To track email being edited
  - `currentFollowup` - To track follow-up being edited
  - `currentCampaign` - To track campaign being viewed

### Testing Implementation
Added a test system to make it easier to verify that the components are working:
1. Created a `test.html` file that simulates Gmail's interface
2. Added message listener in `content/index.js` to handle test messages
3. Updated manifest to allow extension to run on test page
4. Created a `test.sh` script to simplify launching the test environment

## Key Challenges Overcome
1. **Chrome Extension Resource Loading**: Worked around CSP restrictions by implementing components inline
2. **Rich Text Editing**: Implemented text editing with execCommand for cross-browser compatibility
3. **State Management**: Enhanced state tracking to support navigation between new components
4. **Styling Consistency**: Maintained consistent styling with existing components

## Future Improvements
1. Implement actual API service integration
2. Add real data persistence using Chrome storage API
3. Add proper error handling and loading states
4. Implement remaining missing modules (Contact Management, Company Management, Settings)
5. Refine the UI for better usability
6. Add unit tests for components and behaviors

## Running the Test Environment
1. Run `./test.sh` to open the test page
2. Use the buttons to test different components
3. Monitor the console for messages
